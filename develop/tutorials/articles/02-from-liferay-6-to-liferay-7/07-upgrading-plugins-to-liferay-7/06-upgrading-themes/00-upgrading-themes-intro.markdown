# Upgrading Themes [](id=upgrading-themes-intro)

If you've developed themes in @product@ 7.0, as part of your upgrade you'll 
want to use them in @product-ver@. The upgrade process requires several 
modifications. The 
[Liferay Theme Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes)
helps automate this process. 

The following tutorials show you how to upgrade your Liferay Portal themes to 
@product-ver@:
