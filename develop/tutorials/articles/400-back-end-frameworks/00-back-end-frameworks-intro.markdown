# Back-end Frameworks [](id=back-end-frameworks)

What are back-end frameworks? Are they important? If so, why aren't they
up-front and center in the docs? Good questions.

Back-end frameworks are analogous to supporting actors and actresses in show
business. They fill out the stories in films we know and love. As actors bring
richness and life to their films, Liferay's powerful back-end frameworks bring
essential services and deliver terrific performances of their own. Here are some
of the frameworks:

- Device Recognition
- Portlet Providers
- Data Scopes
- Message Bus

These frameworks and more deliver smashing performances and are stars in their
own right.
