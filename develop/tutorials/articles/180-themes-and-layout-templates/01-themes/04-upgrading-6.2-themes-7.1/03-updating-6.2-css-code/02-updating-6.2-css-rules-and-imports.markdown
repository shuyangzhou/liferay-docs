# Updating 6.2 CSS Rules and Imports [](id=updating-6-2-css-rules-and-imports)

@product-ver@ uses Bootstrap 4's CSS rule syntax. Font Awesome icons have also 
been moved, requiring changes to your imports. If your theme uses the Liferay 
Themes Node.js SDK, the Gulp `upgrade` task reports automatic CSS updates and 
suggests manual updates. For example, here is part of the task log for the Lunar 
Resort theme upgrade from 6.2 to 7.0. For each update performed and suggested, 
the task reports a file name and line number range:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Bootstrap Upgrade (2 to 3)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    File: src/css/_aui_variables.scss
        Line 5: "$white" has been removed
        Line 11: "$baseBorderRadius" has changed to "$border-radius-base"
        Line 15: "$btnBackground" has changed to "$btn-default-bg"
        Line 16: "$btnBackgroundHighlight" has been removed
        Line 17: "$btnBorder" has changed to "$btn-default-border"
        ...
    File: src/css/custom.css
        Line 201: Padding no longer affects width or height, you may need to
        change your rule (lines 201-227)
        Line 207: Padding no longer affects width or height, you may need to
        change your rule (lines 207-226)
        Line 212: You would change height from "62px" to "82px"
        ...

## Manually Updating CSS Rules [](id=manually-updating-css-rules)

Follow these steps to update your theme's CSS rules manually:

1.  Since Bootstrap 3 adopted the `box-sizing: border-box` property for all 
    elements and pseudo-elements (e.g., `:before` and `:after`), padding no 
    longer affects dimensions. 
    [Bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#less-mixins-box-sizing) 
    describes the box sizing changes. In all CSS rules that use padding, make 
    sure to update the width and height. For example, examine the `height` value 
    change in this CSS rule for the Lunar Resort theme's `_custom.scss` file:

    Original:

        #reserveBtn {
        	background-color: #00C4FB;
        	border-radius: 10px;
        	color: #FFF;
        	font-size: 1.5em;
        	height: 62px;
        	margin: 30px;
        	padding: 10px 0;
        	...
        }

    Updated:

        #reserveBtn {
        	background-color: #00C4FB;
        	border-radius: 10px;
        	color: #FFF;
        	font-size: 1.5em;
        	height: 82px;
        	margin: 30px;
        	padding: 10px 0;
        	...
        }

    **Note:** For individual elements, you can overwrite the 
    `box-sizing:border-box` rule with `box-sizing:content-box`.

2.  The following variables are removed in Bootstrap 4. Remove any of these if 
    they are used in your theme:

        $line-height-computed
        $padding-base-horizontal
        $padding-base-vertical
        $padding-large-horizontal
        $padding-large-vertical
        $padding-small-horizontal
        $padding-small-vertical
        $padding-xs-horizontal
        $padding-xs-vertical
        $gray-base
        $gray-darker
        $gray-dark
        $gray
        $gray-light
        $gray-lighter
        $brand-primary
        $brand-success
        $brand-info
        $brand-warning
        $brand-danger
        $state-success-text
        $state-success-bg
        $state-success-border
        $state-info-text
        $state-info-bg
        $state-info-border
        $state-warning-text
        $state-warning-bg
        $state-warning-border
        $state-danger-text
        $state-danger-bg
        $state-danger-border

See the 
[Migrating from 2.x to 3.0 guide](http://getbootstrap.com/migration/#migrating-from-2x-to-30) 
for CSS rules that changed in Bootstrap 3. Likewise, you can refer to the 
[Migrating to v4 guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/) 
for updating CSS rules to Bootstrap 4. 

## Updating Font Awesome Imports [](id=updating-font-awesome-imports)

Font Awesome icons were moved to their own file (`font-awesome.scss`) to avoid 
the IE9 CSS selector limitation. If you include these imports in your 
`_custom.scss` file, you must remove them:

    @import "aui/alloy-font-awesome/scss/mixins-alloy";
    @import "aui/alloy-font-awesome/scss/variables";
