# Applying Clay Design Patterns [](id=applying-clay-design-patterns-to-6-2-themes)

@product-ver@ uses 
[Clay](https://liferay.github.io/clay/), 
a web implementation of Liferay's 
[Lexicon Experience Language](https://lexicondesign.io/). 
The Lexicon Experience Language provides styling guidelines and best practices 
for application UIs. Clay's CSS, HTML, and JavaScript components enable 
developers to build fully-realized UIs quickly and effectively. @product@'s 
[compatibility layer](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-bootstrap-3-lexicon-css-compatibility-layer) 
let's you use 
[Lexicon CSS](https://lexiconcss.wedeploy.io/) 
markup alongside 
[Clay CSS](https://clayui.com/). 
This section demonstrates how to apply Clay to your HTML markup. For example, 
this is the Liferay Portal 6.2 Lunar Resort's reservation form:

    <p>
    Thanks for choosing to stay at the Liferay Lunar Resort! Please fill out the 
    form below to book your stay. We know you have a choice in where to stay on 
    the Moon... 
    oh wait no you don't. Thanks for picking us anyways. We'll see you soon on 
    the Moon!
    </p>

    <form class="form-horizontal">
            <fieldset>
              <legend>Reservation Form</legend>
              <div class="control-group">
                  <label class="control-label" for="inputName">Name</label>
                  <div class="controls">
                          <input type="text" id="inputName"
                          placeholder="Enter your Name here" required="required">
                      </div>
              </div>
              <div class="control-group">
                  <label class="control-label" for="inputEmail">Email</label>
                  <div class="controls">
                      <input type="email" id="inputEmail"
                      placeholder="Enter your E-Mail here" required="required">
                  </div>
              </div>
              <div class="control-group">
                  <div class="controls">
                      <button type="submit" class="btn">Submit</button>
                  </div>
              </div>
            </fieldset>
    </form>

The Clay updates applied to the form are as follows:

-   The `control-group` classes were updated to `form-group` classes.
-   The `control-label` classes were removed from the `label` elements.
-   The `<div class=""controls>` elements were removed.
-   The `form-control` class was added to each `input` element.
-   To emphasize the form's submit button, the `btn-primary` class was added.

You can apply similar Clay patterns to your theme's HTML files. 

You've updated your theme to @product-ver@! You can deploy it from your theme 
project. Now your users can continue enjoying the visual styles you've created 
in your upgraded themes.
