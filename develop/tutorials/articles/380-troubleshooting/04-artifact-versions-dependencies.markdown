# Identifying Liferay Artifact Versions for Dependencies [](id=identifying-liferay-artifact-versions-for-dependencies)

When you're developing an application using Liferay APIs or tools---for example,
you might create a Service Builder application or use Message Bus or Asset
Framework---you must determine which versions of Liferay artifacts (modules,
apps, etc.) you application's modules must specify as dependencies. To learn
how to find Liferay artifacts and  configure dependencies on them, see
