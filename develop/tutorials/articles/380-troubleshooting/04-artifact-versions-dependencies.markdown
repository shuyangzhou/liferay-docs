# Identifying Liferay Artifact Versions for Dependencies [](id=identifying-liferay-artifact-versions-for-dependencies)

When you're developing an application on @product@, it's often necessary to use
various Liferay APIs or tools. For example, you might want to create a Service
Builder application or use Message Bus or Asset Framework. How can  you
determine which versions of Liferay artifacts (modules, apps, etc.) your
application's modules need to specify as dependencies? To learn how to find
Liferay artifacts and  configure dependencies on them, see
