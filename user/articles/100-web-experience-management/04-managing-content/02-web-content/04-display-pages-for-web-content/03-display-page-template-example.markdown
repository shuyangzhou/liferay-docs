# Display Page Template Example

[TOC levels=1-4]

Create a new Display Page Template:

1.  Go to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* in Site Administration.

2.  Go to the *Display Page Templates* tab.

3.  Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../../../images/icon-add.png)).

4.  Name your Display Page *Lunar Resort Display Page Template* and click
    *Save*.

![Figure 1: The Display Page Template creation interface.](../../../../../images/create-display-page.png)

To build the Display Page Template, you can add any number of Fragments---with
and without editable content---to the page to build your design. Fragments with
editable content can have their editable fields mapped to be filled by a Web
Content article. You can also base it on a specific Web Content Structure.

![Figure 2: Editing a Display Page Template with some Fragments added.](../../../../../images/display-page-with-fragments.png)

Notice that the example has an editable title and text body, with a static
footer containing graphics and links. After you've added some fragments to the
page, you can map them like this:

1.  Click on the *Mapping* tab inside the *Fragments* section.

2.  Open the *Content Type* dropdown and select *Web Content Article* and 
    *Basic Web Content* for the Subtype.

4.  Click *Save*.

<!--5.  Now check the box that says *Show Editable Areas*. This highlights
    areas that you can map.-->

<!--6.  Click on an editable text area and then click *Map*. A dialog appears with
    a list of fields that can be mapped to that area.-->

5.  Navigate to the *Section Builder* &rarr; *Basic Components* tab in the right
    menu.

7.  Add a *Heading 1* and *Text* components to the appropriate areas.

8.  Click *Publish* at the top of the page to save your work.

You now have a Display Page Template with static graphics and a text area that's 
replaced with whatever content you add to it.

| **Note:** You can map any data or metadata from a Web Content Article or
| Structure to a Display Page Template. For the Basic Web Content type, this includes
| structure-defined fields like Summary, Title, and Content, as well as metadata
| fields like Publish Date, Categories, and Tags. In a user-defined structure, all
| user selected fields display here as well.

## Publishing with Display Page Templates

Now create a short article to display with this display page template:

1.  Go to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Web Content* in Site Administration.

2.  Add a Basic Web Content article.

3.  Name it *Thoughts About Space* and fill in some short content.

4.  Open the *Display Page Template* section and under the dropdown, select
    *Specific Display Page Template*. Then click *Select*.

5.  Select the *Lunar Resort Display Page Template* and click *Done*.

6.  Click *Publish*.

![Figure 4: Selecting the Asset type and Subtype.](../../../../../images/display-page-creating-content.png)

When published, you can view the content at its Friendly URL (you can find the
Friendly URL while editing a Web Content article under *Friendly URL*) or when
you click on the content in an Asset Publisher with *Asset Link Behavior* set to
*View in Context*.
