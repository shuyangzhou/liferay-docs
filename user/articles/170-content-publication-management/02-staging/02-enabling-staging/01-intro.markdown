# Enabling Staging

[TOC levels=1-4]

You have two different ways to set up staging:

- [Local Live](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/enabling-local-live-staging)
- [Remote Live](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/enabling-remote-live-staging)

Whether you enable Local Live or Remote Live staging, the interface for managing
and publishing staged pages is the same.

Local Live staging lets you publish site changes quickly, since the staged and
live environments are on the same server. It's also easier to switch between the
staged and live environments using Local Live staging. Since the staged content,
however, is stored in the same database as the production content, your server
must have more resources, and the content isn't as well protected or backed up
as with Remote Live staging. Also, you can't install new versions of widgets for
testing purposes in a Local Live staging environment, since only one version of
an widget can be installed at any given time on a single Liferay server.

With Remote Live staging, your staging and live environments are hosted on
separate servers, so your data is separated. This lets you deploy new versions
of widgets and content to your staging environment without interfering with your
live environment. Publishing is slower, however, with Remote Live staging since
data must be transferred over a network. Of course, you also need more
hardware to run a separate staging server.

Visit the staging environment article (Local or Remote) that most closely aligns
with your goal for staging content.
