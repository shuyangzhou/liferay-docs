# Change Lists

[TOC levels=1-4]

| **Note:** The Change Lists framework is a beta feature and is not currently
| supported at this time.

Change Lists provide a way to track asset changes and how they're displayed
system wide. You can group changes into working *sets* and publish them when
they're ready. This prevents users from seeing changes that aren't ready for
production; you can manage a change list and provide edits to your site in the
background and push to the live environment when they're ready for your
audience.

A change list is not tied to a specific site. This means that you can track
multi-site environments with a single change list.

Change lists support two major changes:

- Asset addition, edit, or deletion
- Asset display (e.g., page, layouts, widget preferences)

| **Note:** Change lists support for pages and layouts are still in development
| and not available for @product@ 7.2 GA1.

The following content types are supported by change lists at this time:

- Web Content
- Web Content Structure
- Web Content Template
