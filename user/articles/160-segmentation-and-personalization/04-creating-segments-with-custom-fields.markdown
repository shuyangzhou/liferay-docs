# Creating Segments with Custom Fields and Session Data

[TOC levels=1-4]

Now that you created a segment, you can take things to the next level and use
a Custom Field to define segment criteria.

## Creating a Custom Field

First, create a custom field to use for the Segment:

1.  In the *Control Panel* go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Custom Fields*.

2.  Click on *User*.

3.  Click the [Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button in the top right.

4.  On the next page, click on *Dropdown*.

5.  For the *Field Name* enter *Cardholder Type*.

6.  For values, enter *None,* *Basic*, *Silver*, and *Gold* on four separate lines.

7.  Click *Save*.

Now any time user is created, they are prompted to enter the *Cardholder Type*,
and existing users can select it from their user profiles.

## Creating the Premium Card Prospects Segment

Next, use a custom field to define another segment. 

1.  From Segments Administration, click the [Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button.

2.  Click in the text area where it says *Unnamed Segment* and enter the name 
    *Premium Card Prospects*.

3.  For *User Properties* select *Cardholder Type*.

4.  Click on the operator field and set it to *equals*.

5.  Select *Basic* from the select box.

9.  Click *Save* to save your Segment.

As you can see, segment criteria can be easily defined using Liferay's built-in
criteria or your own custom fields. Now, let use session data to make this
Segment definition even more robust.

## Extending the Segment With Session Data

So far, you've used criteria derived from user profiles to determine if they
should be members of a segment; now it's time to use session data to make your
criteria more effective.

| Note: For this exercise to work, you must have set a cookie on the 
| specified page.

1.  Click the icon to edit *Session Properties* from the *Premium Card 
    Prospects* segment.
 
2.  Set the comparator for *Session Properties* to *Or*.

3.  Drag *Cookies* into the *Session Properties* section.

4.  Change the selection box to *contains*.

5.  Enter *cards* in the first text box.

Now any user who has a cookie from visiting the *Cards* page is evaluated as
part of the *Premium Card Prospects* segment.
