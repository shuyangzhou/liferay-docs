# Localization and Integrations

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Localization category the Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr;
Instance Settings contains display settings.

## Localization

Set the default instance language and time zone. You can also choose an
instance-wide logo that appears in the top left corners of pages. 

When configuring a new logo, be careful to choose an image file that fits the
space. Large images might overlap with the navigation. 

## Integrations

Instance Settings contains integrations in different categories. Two of them
are analytics and Third Party, both in Platform section.

**Analytics**: Enter an analytics system or remove one of the two
pre-configured options (`google` and `piwik`). Activate these systems here, and
configure them at the 
[site level](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/advanced-site-settings#analytics).

**Third Party &rarr; Maps**: Choose OpenStreetMap or Google Maps as the maps API provider for
geolocalized asset display.
