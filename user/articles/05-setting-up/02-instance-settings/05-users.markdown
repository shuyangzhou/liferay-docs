# Users

[TOC levels=1-4]

Configure user settings at Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Instance
Settings, in the Users category.

The *Users* section has three entries: Personal Menu, Default
User Associations, and Fields.

In the Personal Menu entry, configure whether the personal menu appears in
the Control Menu (as it did in past versions of @product@).

In the Fields entry, enable/disable these fields on the Add/Edit User Form:

- Autogeneration of screen names

- Birthday field

- Gender field

Default User Associations has four fields for listing (one per line) the Sites,
Organization Sites, Roles, and User Groups you want all new Users assigned to
automatically. By default, new Users are assigned to only the Users Role. You
can also choose whether to apply these configurations to existing Users.

User groups are handy tools for pre-populating your Users' private Sites with
pages, assigning Roles and permissions, and managing site membership.
