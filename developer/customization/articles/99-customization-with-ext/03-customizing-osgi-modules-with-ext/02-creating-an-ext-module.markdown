# Creating an Ext Module

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can create an Ext module based off the pre-configured `modules-ext` project
template/archetype. See the
[`modules-ext`](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/modules-ext-template)
project template article for information on how to create an Ext module, its
folder structure, and other important details.

It's recommended to create and develop your Ext module in a
[Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace).
Workspace is preconfigured with an `ext` folder, which applies important
settings (via the `LiferayOSGiExtPlugin`) to your Ext module when it's deployed
to @product@. You'll learn more about this in the next section.

Great! You know how to create an Ext module and are familiar with its folder
structure and most significant files. Next, you'll learn how to develop your Ext
module to customize @product@.
