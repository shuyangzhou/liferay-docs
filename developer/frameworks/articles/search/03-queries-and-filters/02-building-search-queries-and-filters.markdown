# Building Search Queries and Filters

[TOC levels=1-4]

Each filter and query has a different purpose, but the way you'll add the
information to the search request is similar between all queries and filters.

## Queries

The complete dummy code snippet for building the below Query is available for
your copying and pasting convenience at the end of this section.

### Build the Search Query

1.  Use the `com.liferay.portal.search.query.Queries` interface to instantiate
    the query you'll construct. For example,

    ```java
    TermsQuery termsQuery = queries.terms("fieldName");
    ```

    To discover what fields each query must have (e.g., `String field` in the
    case of the above `com.liferay.portal.search.query.TermsQuery`), see the
    [`Queries`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.2.x/modules/apps/portal-search/portal-search-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/portal/search/query/Queries.java) 
    interface.

2.  Build out the query to get the desired response. This looks different
    for each query type, but Elasticsearch's documentation on the query type
    explains it (for example, 
    [Terms Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/query-dsl-terms-query.html)).

    For a Terms Query, you might just add terms to the query:

    ```java
    termsQuery.addValues("value1", "value2");
    ```

Once the query itself is in good shape, feed it to the search request.

### Build the Search Request

2.  Get an instance of `com.liferay.portal.search.searcher.SearchRequestBuilder`
    from the `com.liferay.portal.search.legacy.searcher.SearchRequestBuilderFactory` service:

    ```java
    SearchRequestBuilder searchRequestBuilder = searchRequestBuilderFactory.getSearchRequestBuilder();
    ```

3.  Get a `com.liferay.portal.search.searcher.SearchRequest` instance from the
    builder, then add the query to it and run its `build` method:

    ```java
    SearchRequest searchRequest = searchRequestBuilder.query(termsQuery).build();
    ```

4.  To instead use the constructed query in a filter context, call the
    `postFilterQuery` method:

    ```java
    SearchRequest searchRequest = searchRequestBuilder.postFilterQuery(termsQuery).build();
    ```

    When constructing a search request, you'll often find it necessary to chain
    the builder methods together:

    ```java
    SearchRequest searchRequest = 
        searchRequestBuilder.postFilterQuery(myQuery1).query(myQuery2).build();
    ```

    Doing this allows you to add filters and queries (and anything else from
    the builder API) to the same request in one fell swoop.

### Execute the Search Request

1.  Perform a search using the `com.liferay.portal.search.searcher.Searcher`
    service and the `SearchRequest` to get a
    `com.liferay.portal.search.searcher.SearchResponse`:

    ```java
    SearchResponse searcher.search(searchRequest);
    ```

2.  To satisfy the dependencies of the example code here, get a reference to
    `com.liferay.portal.search.searcher.SearchRequestBuilderFactory` and
    `com.liferay.portal.search.searcher.Searcher`:

    ```java
    @Reference
    protected Searcher searcher;

    @Reference
    SearchRequestBuilderFactory searchRequestBuilderFactory;
    ```

Here's the complete code snippet:

```java
    TermsQuery termsQuery = queries.terms("fieldName");

    termsQuery.addValues("value1", "value2");

    SearchRequestBuilder searchRequestBuilder = searchRequestBuilderFactory.getSearchRequestBuilder();

    SearchRequest searchRequest = searchRequestBuilder.query(termsQuery).build();

    SearchResponse searcher.search(searchRequest);

    @Reference
    protected Searcher searcher;

    @Reference
    SearchRequestBuilderFactory searchRequestBuilderFactory;
```

### Process the Search Response

What you'll do with the `SearchResponse` returned by the `searcher.search` call
is dependent on the type of query and your specific use case. See the
documentation on searching programmatically for more information.

## Filters

Filters as a distinct API-level object in @product@ are going away. It's best to
mirror the APIs of the search engine, and neither supported search engine makes
an API level distinction between queries and filters. In recognition of this,
there's a new way to perform post-filtering, which is filtering the returned
search documents at the end of the search request (after calculating any
aggregations). Add the filter to the query using the `postFilterQuery` method in
the request builder:

```java 
SearchRequestBuilder.postFilterQuery(Query);
```

As you can see, this takes a `Query` object, not a `Filter`. Therefore,
construct the `Query` as in the previous section, and specify it as
a post-filter while building the request. All of the legacy `Filter` objects
from `portal-kernel` can now be constructed as queries, per the above
query-building documentation.

### Legacy Filters in Legacy Search Calls

Constructing the filters found in `portal-kernel`'s
`com.liferay.portal.kernel.search.filter` package is demonstrated by this `new`
term filter:

```java
TermFilter termFilter = new TermFilter("fieldName", "filterValue");
```

Filters are added in legacy search calls by going through the `Indexer`
framework's `postProcessContextBooleanFilter` method, which is invoked while the
search framework is constructing the main search query. See the 
[`UserIndexer`'s `addContextQueryParams` method](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.2.x/modules/apps/users-admin/users-admin-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/users/admin/internal/search/UserIndexer.java), 
which is called in the overridden `postProcessContextBooleanFilter` to add the
filter logic.
