# Upgrading Ext Plugins

    <p>Upgrading Ext Plugins<br>Step 1 of 1</p>
</div>

Ext plugins let you use internal APIs and even let you overwrite @product@ core
files. This puts your deployment at risk of being incompatible with security,
performance, or feature updates released by Liferay. When upgrading to a new
version of @product@, you must review all changes and manually modify your Ext
projects to merge your changes with @product@'s.

During your upgrade to @product-ver@, it's highly recommended to leverage an
extension point to customize @product@ instead of using you existing Ext plugin,
if possible. @product-ver@ provides many extension points that let you customize
almost every detail of @product@. If there's a way to customize what you want
with an extension point, do it that way instead. See the
[More Extensible, Easier to Maintain](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/benefits-of-liferay-7-for-liferay-6-developers#more-extensible-easier-to-maintain)
section for more details on the advantages of using @product@'s extension
points.

For more information on Ext projects, how to decide if you need one, and how to
manage them, see the
[Customization with Ext](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customization-with-ext)
section.
