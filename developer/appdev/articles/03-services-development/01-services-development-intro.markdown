# Services Development

[TOC levels=1-4]

Apps need services. Local services are required to implement an app's business 
logic, and remote services are required to expose select portions of that 
business logic to the outside world. An app without services is like a sandwich 
without bread; you might be able to eat it, but your hands will be really messy. 
Bad analogies aside, Liferay provides several tools that can generate your app's 
local and remote services. 

[Service Builder](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/service-builder) 
can generate your app's model, persistence, and service layers. And since 
Service Builder is a highly flexible tool, you can customize the code it 
generates to your needs. 

[REST Builder](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/rest-builder) 
can generate 
[headless REST APIs](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/headless-rest-apis) 
for your app. Such APIs follow the 
[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) 
specification and can be consumed by other apps. 

Here, you'll learn how to use these tools to construct all the services your app 
needs. You'll be a master sandwich maker in no time!
