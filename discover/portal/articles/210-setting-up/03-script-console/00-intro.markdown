# Using Liferay's Script Engine [](id=using-liferays-script-engine)

@product@ provides a robust script engine for executing
[Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
scripts. You can execute scripts to perform maintenance tasks like data
cleanup, user maintenance operations, bulk invocations of Liferay's API, or
even system level operations in the scripting console.

These tutorials cover the following scripting topics: 

- [Invoking Liferay services](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/invoking-liferay-services-from-scripts)

- [Running scripts from the script console](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/running-scripts-from-the-script-console)

- [Using the script engine with workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/leveraging-the-script-engine-in-workflow)

- [Script examples](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/script-examples)

The most common use of the scripting console is to invoke Liferay's services,
so that's covered first. Familiarity with Liferay's API makes the scripting
console a useful tool.
