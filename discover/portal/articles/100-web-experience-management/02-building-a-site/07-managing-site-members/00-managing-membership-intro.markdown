# Managing Members in Your Site [](id=managing-members-in-your-site)

Users and Sites are important concepts. Sites are where all your content and 
pages are stored, and Users access and create that content. While user
management is covered in depth in our 
[User Management tutorial](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-users),
there are other user configuration options specific to Site Management:

- Adding members to Sites administratively
- Adding members to Sites automatically
- Creating Teams of Site members for various functions


This section of tutorials shows you how to manage and configure these Site
options for Users.
