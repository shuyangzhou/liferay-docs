# Managing Site Settings for Members [](id=managing-site-settings-for-members)

Now you'll learn how to set some global settings for your Sites: site membership types, default user associations, and Site ratings. 

1.  Open the *Product Menu* and use the site selector to choose the site you 
    want to configure.

2.  In Site Administration, go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Site Settings*.


## Details [](id=details)

*Details* shows the same form you filled out when first creating your Lunar
Resort Site. This allows an administrator to change the description and
membership type of a Site. The membership type can be set as open, restricted,
or private. Users can join and leave an open Site at will. To join a restricted
Site, a User must be added by the Site administrator. A User can also request
membership through the Sites section of the Control Panel. A private Site is
like a restricted Site but doesn't appear in the Sites section of the Control
Panel for Users who aren't members.

You can organize Sites into hierarchies. At the bottom of the Details
sub-section is the Parent Site section, where you can select the
parent site for the currently selected Site. After selecting a parent Site,
you have a checkbox option to limit membership to members of the parent Site.

## Default User Associations [](id=default-user-associations)

When you have saved your Site settings, you can begin assigning Users to Roles
and Teams. Still inside *Site Settings*, go to the *Advanced* section.
*Default User Associations*, the leading option when opening the Advanced tab,
lets you configure Site Roles and Teams that newly assigned Site members get by
default. To learn more about creating Roles, visit the 
[Roles and Permissions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions)
tutorial.

## Ratings and Mentions [](id=ratings)

Next, open the *Social* section of *Site Administration*. From *Ratings* you
can enable ratings for applications in the Site. You can also select ratings
types like Stars, Likes, and Thumbs.

The last configuration option in Site Settings related to managing Users is
*Mentions* in the Social tab, where you can enable/disable 
[Mentioning Users](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/mentioning-users).
This lets Users *mention* (notify and/or draw attention to) friends and
colleagues by entering the "@" character followed by their user names. 

Next, you can learn about Teams.
