# Enabling CAPTCHA on Form Submissions [](id=enabling-captcha-on-form-submissions)

[CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) 
prevents a bot from submitting forms. It's often used in 
[login apps](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/logging-into-liferay), 
but you can also use it in the Forms app. 

To enable CAPTCHA, click the form's *Options* button 
(![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) 
and select *Settings*. Enable the *Require CAPTCHA* setting, click *Done*, and 
save the form. That's all there is to it!
