# Site Initializers [](id=site-initializers)

A Site Initializer is a type of Site template that does much of the work of
setting up a store. A Site Initializer is a convenient sandbox for gaining
familiarity with @commerce@ but it can also be a head start on setting up a live
Site.

Typically, a Site Initializer gives you a theme, a set of customer-facing pages
with a working interface, and a sample catalog.
