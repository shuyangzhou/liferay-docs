# Installing a Search Engine

[TOC levels=1-4]

A search engine is a critical component of your @product@ installation. If
you're here, you probably know the basics already and want to configure a
search engine for your @product@ deployment. 

Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine, is installed by
default, as an embedded server. Elasticsearch is well-supported and almost
certainly meets any search and indexing need you have, but you must not use the
[embedded version in your production deployment](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/elasticsearch#embedded-vs-remote-operation-mode). 

Learn to configure a remote Elasticsearch server or cluster
[here](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/installing-elasticsearch).

[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr) 
is another capable and popular search engine supported in @product@. 

<!--Learn to configure a remote Solr server or cluster 
here(/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/installing-solr).

## Choosing a Search Engine

Elasticsearch and Solr are both supported, but there are some differences in how
they work with @product@. In certain cases, you must choose Elasticsearch. 

If you answer _yes_ to either of these questions, you must choose Elasticsearch:

1.  You're using @commerce@.

2.  Your custom search code requires the use of the `TermsSetFilter` API or the
    Geolocation APIs that are implemented in the Liferay Connector to
    Elasticsearch.

@commerce@ requires the `TermsSetFilter` implementation, only available in the
Elasticsearch connector.

Both of these Elasticsearch-only developer features are not currently
implemented in the Liferay Connector to Solr, but may be added in the future.
If you must use either of those features in your search solution's code, use
Elasticsearch. If you're using @commerce@, use Elasticsearch.
Otherwise, feel free to use Elasticsearch or Solr to index your portal content.

Another factor to consider in your search engine selection is JDK version. The
search engine and @product@ must use the same JDK version and distribution
(e.g., Oracle Open JDK 1.8.0_201). Consult the 
[Elasticsearch compatibility matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm)
and the 
[@product@ compatibility matrix](https://web.liferay.com/documents/14/21598941/Liferay+DXP+7.1+Compatibility+Matrix/9f9c917a-c620-427b-865d-5c4b4a00be85) 
to learn more about supported JDK distributions and versions. This consideration
is not necessary for Solr, because no JVM level serialization happens between
the servers. All communication occurs at the HTTP level.
